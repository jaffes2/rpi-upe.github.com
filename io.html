          <h2>Rensselaer UPE I/O Events</h2>
          <p>
            We hold a special lectures series called I/Os multiple times a semester. A UPE I/O is a forum to introduce students to interesting & useful technologies that they would otherwise not come into contact with, in a way that will aid them in growing personally, academically, and professionally. The typical format is to recruit a speaker who is knowledgeable about the technology at hand, and have them give an overview of what it is, what problems it solves, and how to use it.
          <p>
          
          <br/>
          <h3> Upcoming I/Os </h3>
          <h4> April 3rd, 2015: Web Exploitation </h4>
          <h5> 5pm-7pm @ DCC 324 </h5>
          <p> UPE partners with <a href="http://rpis.ec/"> RPISec </a> for an Introduction to Web Exploitation I/O. 
            This interactive talk will focus on how one would go about poking at popular HTML5 based games such as Cookie Clicker, 2048, Chain Rxn, and how you can cheat or manipulate them using nothing but your browser.
            Bring a laptop and have a decent browser installed like Chrome! 
          </p>

          <h3>Past I/Os</h3>
          <h4>February 20, 2015: Google Go</h4>
          <p>
            Go (also Golang) is a new open source language. Initially developed by Google but now a separate software project, it is intended to be a major systems language superior to C++. It features garbage collection, type safety with some dynamic typing, and a large emphasis on concurrency.
          </p>
          <p>
            The language's official site is <a href="http://golang.org">golang.org</a>. You can try Go on the official site or using <a href="http://repl.it/languages/go">repl.it</a>.
